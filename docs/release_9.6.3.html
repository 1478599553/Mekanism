Please check your config changes with this version!<br>
Everything should be ok, but some internal structures were made.<br>
<br>
We also have new config options
<ul>
    <li>WindGenerationDimBlacklist - blacklist Wind Generators from a dimension</li>
    <li>digitalMinerMaxRadius - define the max block radius for the Digital Miner</li>
    <li>OsmiumVeinSize, CopperVeinSize, TinVeinSize, SaltVeinSize - complementing the existing options, these let you set the size of the veins</li>
</ul>
